                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p><strong>Search for the Good</strong> is a platform under development that connects individuals, projects, and brands dedicated to making a positive impact in the world. By fostering connections between purpose-driven people, impactful projects, and trusted brands, the platform aims to inspire and amplify good. Search for the Good addresses issues in social media such as superficial engagement, negativity, and passive consumption by creating a carefully curated community focused on authenticity and real-world action.</p>

                <h2>Purpose and Solution</h2>
                <p>The platform seeks to counteract the negative aspects of traditional social media by providing a space where people can connect over shared values, collaborate on meaningful projects, and discover brands that prioritize social good. Search for the Good encourages genuine connections, volunteering, mentorship, and collaboration in a positive environment.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Current Progress</h2>
                <p>I am actively building the platform and have started engaging with potential users. Iâ€™m also collaborating with two organizations, Greenpop and Goodgym, to develop features that support their community initiatives.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>How It Works</h2>

                    <li><strong>Get an Interview:</strong> Prospective members undergo an interview to confirm their commitment to positive impact.</li>
                    <li><strong>Create a Profile:</strong> Members share their values and intentions, and they can list any projects or brands they are involved with.</li>
                    <li><strong>Use the Platform:</strong> Members can connect with others, explore projects to support or learn from, and discover brands aligned with their values.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Vision and Long-Term Goals</h2>
                <p>Search for the Good aims to grow slowly and intentionally, focusing on quality over quantity. The ultimate goal is to become a global hub for impact-driven connections and collaboration, fostering a community that brings more optimism and light to the world.</p>
