                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>Trybe Social is a platform designed to help individuals create close-knit groups of friends and connect with like-minded people. By linking users based on shared interests, location, and age group, Trybe Social fosters meaningful relationships and provides opportunities for users to engage in real-life activities and events with compatible individuals.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Problem Identification</h2>
                <p>In today’s digital age, young adults often find it challenging to build close, authentic friendships, especially when relocating to a new city or working remotely. Trybe Social addresses this gap by creating a space where users can easily connect with others who share their interests and social vibe, making it simpler to <em>find your people</em> and form genuine connections.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Research and Ideation</h2>
                <p>The team explored social networking trends and conducted interviews with young adults to understand their challenges with meeting new people and sustaining friendships. Through this research, we identified that users desired a platform focused on fostering deeper connections rather than casual acquaintances. This insight led to Trybe Social’s mission of finding people with shared goals for connection and community.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Design Approach</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Intentional Matching:</strong> Trybe Social uses an algorithm to connect users based on shared interests, age group, and social preferences, ensuring compatibility and fostering authentic friendships.</li>
                    <li><strong>Community Building:</strong> Users can join or create “Trybes” — groups based on common interests, such as hiking or movie nights, and larger public Trybes for open events, creating both intimate and community-wide experiences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Engagement Tools:</strong> Features include group chats for planning meetups, options to save profiles and Trybes, and the ability to share videos that reflect personal interests and experiences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Event Planning:</strong> Users can plan private and public events within Trybes, allowing them to meet in real life for activities like beach days or BBQs, fostering closer connections and lasting memories.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Implementation and Launch</h2>
                <p>The team built prototypes using Flutterflow to create an intuitive experience for users to join Trybes, connect with others, and organize events. After development, I helped the team successfully launch Trybe Social on the US App Store, making the platform available to a broad user base.</p>

                <h2>Current Status</h2>
                <p><em>Currently, the team is still working on the project and is implementing new features on the App Store.</em></p>
