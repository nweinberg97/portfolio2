                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p><strong>Knit</strong> is a community-building platform aimed at enhancing the quality of life for residents in long-term care facilities by connecting them with local businesses that provide classes, workshops, and events. The platform was developed during a hackathon, where it won second place, and the team built a prototype on Figma.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Purpose and Solution</h2>
                <p>Knit addresses the issue of social isolation among older adults, especially those in long-term care homes, which became even more pronounced during COVID-19. By creating a network of activities and experiences, Knit helps residents remain socially active and mentally stimulated. The platform connects residents with diverse, engaging activities, fostering a sense of community and well-being.</p>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Key Features and Strategy</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Subscription Model:</strong> Knit generates revenue through facility and provider subscriptions, where long-term care facilities pay a monthly fee per resident, and local businesses pay to feature their services.</li>
                    <li><strong>Targeted Approach:</strong> Focused on long-term care homes in Vancouver, Knit differentiates itself from other community platforms by catering specifically to the elderly population.</li>
                    <li><strong>Collaborative Model:</strong> Through partnerships with local businesses, Knit offers an array of events and experiences, allowing residents to explore new skills, activities, and social connections.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Market and Impact</h2>
                <p>With approximately 64,420 older adults living in long-term care facilities in Vancouver, Knit taps into a market that values meaningful engagement. By addressing mental health and social isolation, Knit strives to thread together a vibrant, supportive community for seniors.</p>
