            <p>Welcome to the page about my upcoming book, "Changing Tides: The Ways the Waves Take Us." 
                Here, you'll find updates, exclusive previews, and more information about the book's release.</p>
            <h3 class="bookh3a">Summary:</h3> 
            <p>Changing Tides is a story of triumph, as a young 18-year-old, goes on an unimaginable journey to chase 
                his dream of surfing in the Gold Coast. Surviving a stroke, overcoming obstacles, and the unpredictable 
                and ever-changing waves that life brings him. </p>
            <p>Changing Tides is also a reflection on life, a metaphor for change and an homage to the main character's 
                love for surfing. Each chapter takes the reader on a roller coaster ride of emotion and shows us all the 
                ways the waves of life can take us, while sharing key lessons learned throughout the journey. Using personal 
                surfing analogies, and references to the ocean, the author illustrates key themes like change, overcoming 
                challenges, growth, letting go, self-love, freedom, and more throughout the book. </p>
            <p>However, this unconventional story has a twist ending… At 26-years of age, his story is not yet over. The 
                last chapter, unfinished, outlines what the main character dreams of creating in what he calls the “deep blue”, 
                a metaphor for the ocean of opportunity in the world. He shares the ripples he’d like to leave to make the world 
                a better place and outlines how readers can join him in making this happen.
